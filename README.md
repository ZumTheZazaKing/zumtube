# ZumTube
A video sharing app that I made for fun

### Why did you make this?
I was scrolling through one of those **Cool React Projects You Should Do In 2021** articles (forgot the link), and then I saw **Video Sharing App e.g. YouTube**.

I was like "Alright, I haven't done this yet. Might as well challenge myself",

And so I did.


### What did I learn?
That something like this is tricky to make, LOL. But once you get the concept, things start getting smooth; for a while...

### What does it do?
It's just like YouTube, but **really** run-down and lost most of it's features but it still serves it's main purpose which is sharing videos

## Technologies I used
- React (Front-end)
- Firebase (Back-end)
- Netlify (Deployment)

**The reason I chose React for front-end** is because it offers a lot of packages which I can use to ease the development of this app. I also chose React because I like it. Oh! By the way, I used **CRA** to get things started

**The reason I chose Firebase for back-end** is because I wouldn't have to bother myself with back-end stuff for I am more of a front-end developer. It gets all the hard work done and it can easily be integrated with React. It's also free to use, within a certain quota that is.

**The reason I chose Netlify for deployment** is because it can deploy React apps with ease and this app is more to front-end than back-end so **Heroku** was crossed out.

### Future Features
I might add notifications if I'm willing to maintain this app but the chances of that are quite low so...yeah
